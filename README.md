QUESTION 1 Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. - (ANSWER) (1) Software engineering is a step by step process of designing, developing,testing and maintaining software by applying engineering principles. SOftware engineering iS important in the techonlogy space because its allows the developemnt of healthcare, finance systems,communication systems and many more. Software engineering leads to involutionary change in the qaulity of products and systems I have listed above, reduced overtime and ensure that techonlogy space is secure and realible. QUESTION 2 Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. (ANSWERS) (1) Strucutred Programaming- This evolved in the 1970s, the introudctionof strucured programming practices marked a shift from unstructured "sphagetti code" to organized code blocks, ehnacing teliability and maintenance of software systems. (2) Object-oriented Programming(OOP)- Objected oriented programming evolved in the 1980s the OOP aspect enabled software developers to model complex systems with reusable "Objects" which improved code reusability and sclability.(3)SDLC System developemnt life-cycle specifically the agile methodology introduction enabled iterative, collaborative prcoesses tha allowed for adpative planning and contionous improvement. QUESTION 3 List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. SDLC phases. ANSWERS (1)Requirements Analysis- Gather and define what the software should do.(2)Design- Planning the softwareâ€™s architecture and structure. (3)Implementation- Writing the code to create the software. (4)Testing- Validating that the software meets requirements and is free of defects. (5)Deployment- Release the software to users. (6)Maintenance-Provide ongoing support and improvements to ensure continued functionality. QUESTION 4 Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.(ANSWERS) ( 1)Waterfall: A linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Appropriate for projects with well-defined requirements, such as government contracts or regulatory compliance systems, where changes are minimal. (2)Agile- An iterative and incremental approach that allows for adaptability and continuous feedback. Agile is ideal for projects with evolving requirements, such as consumer apps or startups, where user feedback and flexibility are critical. QUESTION 5 Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. ANSWERS (1)Software Developer-Writes and maintains code, implements features, and collaborates on technical solutions. (2)Quality Assurance Engineer: Designs and executes tests to identify defects, ensure functionality, and maintain software quality.(3)Project Manager: Oversees the project timeline, coordinates team efforts, manages resources, and ensures that the project aligns with business objectives. QUESTION 6 Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. ANSWERS (1)IDEs-These tools provide a development environment that includes code editors, debuggers, and other features to improve productivity (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA). (2)VCS-Version Control Systems track changes to code, enabling collaboration and helping teams manage versions of their codebase (e.g., Git, GitHub). They are crucial for teamwork, allowing developers to work on different features simultaneously without conflicts. QUESTION 7 What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. (ANSEWRS) (1)Managing Complexity- Use modular designs and keep code as simple as possible. (2)Handling Changing Requirements- Agile methodologies can help adapt to changes quickly. (3)Ensuring Quality-Implement rigorous testing at each SDLC phase and encourage code reviews. QUESTION 8 Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. (ANSWERS)(1)Unit Testing-Testing individual components for functionality. (2)Integration Testing- Ensures that combined parts work together. System Testing: Evaluates the complete system's performance and behavior.(3)Acceptance Testing- Validates the software against user requirements, ensuring it meets expectations and is ready for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

QUESTION 1 PART 2 Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.(ANSEWERS) (1)Prompt engineering is the process of crafting specific inputs (or "prompts") to guide AI models, such as language models, to produce desired outputs.(2)Effective prompt engineering is essential in interacting with AI because it ensures that the AI produces relevant, coherent, and useful responses, which can save time and improve results. QUESTION 2 PART 2 Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. (ANSWERS) (1)Vague Prompt-This explains software development. (2)Improved Prompt- Describe the software development process, including key stages like requirements analysis, design, implementation, and testing, with an example for each. (3)Why It's Better- The improved prompt is specific and concise, guiding the AI to provide a comprehensive answer by focusing on particular stages and asking for examples, which increases the likelihood of a thorough and relevant response.
